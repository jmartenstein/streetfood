Sinatra / HAML based web app. Used to track street food trucks around Seattle.

Start by running "ruby server/streetfood.rb"

Pages:
	1) Master list of all neighborhoods (layout derivative of Craigslist)
	2) Individual neighborhood page, with next three days of stops
	3) Individual truck page, with next three days of stops

TODO:

- add Neighborhood class to model
- migrate to sass
- add page layout (see above)
- add Food class to model
- determine layout / stylesheet
- view by neighborhood
- view by truck

- add .json and .xml to each page
- figure out onhover for css
